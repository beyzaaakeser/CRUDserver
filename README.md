<h1>CRUD Server Project</h1>

If you are looking for an ideal solution to be more organized in your personal or professional life, this to-do app is for you. You can easily track, update, or delete the tasks marked as work, daily, or important. Be informed of every action you take thanks to the nice notifications I created with Sweet Alert 2. You can use it easily on any device thanks to its responsive design.
